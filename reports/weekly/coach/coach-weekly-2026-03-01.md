### 🔴 Today's Readiness Alert

**Garmin: 27/100 — FIND_TIME_TO_RELAX**
- Sleep: 4h 37min (score 52) — worst of the 2-week window
- HRV: 54ms (68% of personal baseline) — suppressed
- Body Battery: 35 at start of day
- Stress: 41 avg (moderate-high)
- ACWR: 88% (load balance fine — party recovery dragging this)

**The culprit:** Feb 28 party blowout (4730 kcal, alcohol, late night) + Feb 27 hangover day cascaded into tonight's poor sleep (Mar 1). Two consecutive bad nights (5.9h, 4.6h) after sustained training load.

---

### 📈 HRV Trend Analysis

```
Feb 23: 70ms  ↑
Feb 24: 80ms  ↑↑ (peak of week)
Feb 25: 76ms  ↑
Feb 26: 64ms  ↓ (party day)
Feb 27: 62ms  ↓ (hangover)
Feb 28: 79ms  ↑ (rebounded overnight)
Mar  1: 54ms  ↓↓ (party crash fully lands)
```

Mid-week peak then party weekend collapse. The 80ms on Feb 24 is excellent — clean days yield good recovery. The system bounced to 79ms on Feb 28, then a delayed HRV crash today from sustained alcohol+late nights.

**Baseline context:** Dec avg 71ms → Jan avg 74ms → Feb avg 70ms → Today 54ms (outlier, not trend).

---

### 😴 Sleep Analysis

```
Week 1 avg (Feb 16-22): ~7.9h  ← solid base
Week 2 avg (Feb 23-Mar 1): 7.0h  ← social weekend drag
Best: Feb 24 — 8.5h
Worst: Mar 1 — 4.6h (party fallout)
```

Sleep quality deteriorates reliably Thu–Sun with social events. Mon–Wed is excellent (7.1–8.5h). The pattern is structural: social calendar directly impacts recovery.

### 🏃 Training Compliance: 9/14 (64%)

**Completed:**
| Date | Activity | Duration | TSS |
|------|----------|----------|-----|
| Mar 1 | Zwift — The Magnificent 8 | 57min | 44 |
| Mar 1 | Yoga | 14min | 8 |
| Feb 28 | Run | 30min | 45 |
| Feb 27 | Yoga | 9min | 5 |
| Feb 26 | Tennis | 55min | 44 |
| Feb 25 | Yoga | 12min | 6 |
| Feb 24 | Yoga | 61min | 32 |
| Feb 24 | Yoga | 10min | 5 |
| Feb 23 | Yoga | ~5min | 0 |

**Missed:**
- ❌ Feb 25 — Easy Swim (30min)
- ❌ Feb 25 — Strength (60min)
- ❌ Feb 27 — Easy Swim (30min)
- ❌ Feb 27 — Strength (60min)

**Critical miss: ZERO swims this week.** Primary GOALS goal is 2-3x/week toward Masters event. Immediate correction required.

---

### 🎯 Goal Progress

| Goal | Target | This Week | Status |
|------|--------|-----------|--------|
| Swim 2-3x/week | 2–3 sessions | 0 sessions | 🔴 MISSED |
| Yoga practice | 1x studio/week | 6 home sessions | 🟡 Volume ✅ |
| Running | Continuity | 2 runs | ✅ |

---

### 🔑 Key Patterns

1. **Mid-week = optimal training window.** Tue-Thu HRV peaks (70-80ms), best sleep, lowest stress. Front-load harder sessions here.
2. **Weekend social events → 2-day recovery cost.** Party → HRV -10ms + poor sleep × 2 days = Day 3 HRV crash. Budget 48h recovery post-event.
3. **ACWR 88% is healthy.** Fatigue is social/lifestyle, not training-derived. The load balance is fine.
4. **RHR 43bpm avg is excellent.** Strong aerobic base. Cardiovascular adaptation solid.
5. **Structured sessions (swim, strength) sacrificed first when social events hit.** Yoga survives because it's short and low-barrier. Fix: anchor swim slots Tue/Thu mornings as non-negotiable.

## Part B — Weekly Workout Plan: Mar 2–8, 2026

**Theme:** 🔄 Recovery Reset + Swim Reboot
**Context:** HRV 54ms suppressed, sleep debt from party weekend, Body Battery 35. Rebuild recovery while correcting swim deficit.

| **Sat Mar 7** | 🚴 Zwift or Tennis | 60min | 50 | Fun/social — choose by mood |
| **Sun Mar 8** | 🏊 Swim OR Yoga | 35min | 25 | 3rd swim if energy; else yoga + rest |

**Weekly TSS projection: ~289** | CTL impact: +1-2 pts

### 🎯 Week Priorities

1. **🏊 SWIM x2 min (x3 preferred)** — Tue + Thu anchored. Sun optional. Non-negotiable correction.
2. **💪 Strength x2** — Trening A (Wed) + Trening B (Fri). RPE 5-6, full vault protocol.
3. **🧘 Yoga daily** — Keep the streak. Minimum viable session when readiness is poor.
4. **🛌 Sleep first** — No late nights Sun-Thu. 8h target. Performance infrastructure.
5. **🚫 Alcohol-free week** — HRV needs 5+ clean days to fully rebound.
