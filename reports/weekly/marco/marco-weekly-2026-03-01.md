## 📚 Content Covered

### Topics This Week
1. **Lavoro e produttività** (×2 daily lessons, Feb 23–24)
   - Vocab: *la scadenza, lavorare da remoto, gestire il tempo, risolvere un problema, il flusso di lavoro, prendere appunti, il progetto in corso, essere produttivo*
   - Frasi: "Se avessi più tempo, lavorerei da remoto." / "Vorrei proporre un'idea al team." / "Devo affrontare un problema difficile oggi."

2. **Periodo ipotetico (1° e 2° tipo)** — grammar focus, Feb 23
   - Absorption: good — SRS showing 6/8 correct retention
   - Context: workplace usage

3. **Comunicazione e collaborazione al lavoro** — queued for Feb 25 (delivery failed — cron misconfiguration)

4. **Weekend passive content (Feb 27):** Travel framing — "Un viaggio in Italia da sogno"
   - Resources: Coffee Break Italian, Italiano con Lucrezia, Il Post
   - Prompt: *"Se potessi visitare una città italiana questo weekend, dove andresti e perché?"*

## 🔴 Error Patterns (Recurring)

1. **Missing definite articles with work nouns** — *lavoro*, *problema*, *riunione* (multiple occurrences)
   - Root cause: Italian requires article where English omits it. High-frequency nouns triggering autopilot article-dropping.
   - Fix: Article drills before every lesson until zero occurrences for 2 consecutive weeks.

2. **Conjugation under pressure** — *affrontò* (passato remoto) instead of *affronta* (presente)
   - Root cause: Tense switching under speed/stress — defaulting to narrative past tense.
   - Fix: Real-time correction + slow-down protocol.

3. **Lexical confusion under speed** — *panificio* (bakery) instead of *appunti* (notes)
   - Root cause: Retrieval interference between recently-learned low-frequency nouns.
   - Fix: SRS for both items separately; never taught in same session.

## ⚙️ System Events

### Major Restructure (Feb 25)
- **Old:** Free-form conversational lessons around weekly topic
- **New:** 60 structured units (A2→B2), 3-phase flow: Vocab Study → Exercises → Scenario Conversation
- Unit 1/60 created Feb 27–28. Rationale: B1 sessions showed inconsistent scaffolding — errors were environment-induced. Structured units reduce cognitive overload.

### Cron Delivery Failures (Feb 25)
- 3 lesson deliveries failed due to misconfigured Discord/Telegram routing — fixed at 07:10
- Impact: ~1.5 missed lessons this week artificially inflated by system failure

### Anki
- Archived Feb 21 in favor of Convex SRS only. Fewer systems = less friction. SRS retention solid.

## 📈 Trend Analysis

**Rating trajectory:** 1 (Feb 23) → 3 (Feb 24) → no data (Feb 25+). Improving but sample insufficient.

**Session count vs target:** Week 4 = 3/5 (60%). Same shortfall as prior weeks. Thu–Fri–Sat window is consistently dead. This is a behavioral pattern, not a one-off.

**SRS retention:** Periodo ipotetico 6/8 (75%) — above baseline for first-pass grammar. Lavoro vocab articles: insufficient reps, confirmed by error recurrence.

---

## 🎯 Goal Alignment

**Goal:** Hold a 15-minute conversation comfortably (B2)

**Enablers:**
- Periodo ipotetico absorbed — unlocks hypothetical speech, critical for B2
- Travel domain introduced — broadens coverage

**Blockers:**
- 2/5 sessions missed consistently — quantity is the primary lever
- Cron delivery failures created artificial gaps (fixed)
- Unit restructure mid-cycle = brief A2 regression (intentional, strategic)

At current session pace (3/5), the 12-week cycle ends without reaching B2 ceiling.

---

## 🔮 Outlook: Week 5 (Mar 2–8)

- **Monday:** Unit 5 (topic TBD from 12-week plan)
- **Priority drill:** Articles before gendered work nouns — zero errors target
- **Session target:** 5/5 — requires explicit scheduling, not intention
- **SRS:** *appunti* vs *panificio* contrast session; lavoro vocab article reps

## 💡 New Insights

1. **3/5 sessions is a structural pattern.** Thu–Sat is dead space every week. Need either front-loading (Mon–Wed) or a specific Fri trigger tied to a routine.

2. **Mid-cycle restructure is a calculated regression.** Unit 1 A2 content addresses the root of article errors — foundational scaffolding missed by B1 topic-based approach. Better to rebuild now.

3. **Error type 3 (lexical confusion under speed) predicts B2 struggle.** Tom knows both words — this is retrieval interference under time pressure. Fluency = precision under stress. Speed drills needed.

4. **Periodo ipotetico at 75% after one week is above expected baseline.** Grammar absorption is working. The gap is session frequency, not comprehension capacity.
